CAA notes

AZs - Availability Zones
Isolated locations spanned in AWS Regions - which are actual geographical regions.

Amazon DynamoDB - aws nosql db
S3 - aws object storing service (works over http)
aws lambda - faas (function as a service)

Regions - geographical zones, they even receive new services at diff rates (i.e. ireland is the first one to receive new stuff in europe)

AMI - amazon machine image (contains an os and other software)
ssh key pair - allows u to connect to an ec2 instance

CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
- a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing
- an address is described by 2 groups of bits: 
	- the most significant bits 	-> the network prefix	
	- the least significant bits 	-> the host identifier

Classful network design 
- network prefix is one or more 8-bit groups => block of class A, B or C addresses

AWS VPC - virtual private cloud
- lets u create a virtual network that you define, having complete control over your virtual networking environment 
	(IP address ranges, creation of subnets, configuration of route tables and network gateways)
- default subnets are public

Security group
- acts as a virtual firewall (controls inbound and outbound traffic)
- when u launch an instance in a vpc => you can assign up to five security groups
- acts at an instance level => each instance in a subnet in a vpc can be assigned a different set of security groups

Load balancers
- distribute a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units)
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), the aws service for load balancing, supports the following types of load balancers:
	- Application 	
		- an actual proxy between the internet and your application
		- receives a request and makes another request (with the same data) to your application
		- operates at layer 7 (HTTP, WebSockets)
		- replaces the IP of the original client with its own
	- Network
		- kind of like a (very sophisticated) network router
		- operates at layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
		- does not replace the IP of the original client
		- is cheaper than an ALB
	- Classic -> deprecated
	- Gateway
		- operates at layer 3 (network)
		- used if u need to integrate other virtual appliances such as deep packet inspection systems

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
- scales your ec2 instances
- also has features such as health check replacements and scaling policies

CloudFormation - ???

S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- can store data with Object or Block Storage
	- block storage is how our computers store all the data (os and programs)
	- object storage is one big chunk of data file: you can't update it, you need to re-upload the whole file
- usually, s3 buckets are private by default, but if you want to host publicly facing files on it (i.e. the frontend of a website), you should make it public

EBS (Elastic Block Store) - kind of works like S3

CDN (Content Deliveery Network)
- for AWS: CloudFront

RDS (Relational Database Service)
- supports multiple database engines such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostggreSQL etc.

ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- holds your docker images

ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- used as a highly scalable, high performance container manager service (i.e. docker container cluster)
- vasil tip: works like an asg but for containers (i think)

IAM Users - set of credentials (username & password/access keys)
Groups 	- group of users (just like on linux)
Policies
- documents (JSON) describing what an entity can or cannot do; there are 2 types:
- identity-based: they specify what the entity having it attached can do
- resource-based: 	- they are attached to resources (most commonly s3 buckets)
					- they specify who/what has access to it and to what extend
					- the who/what is called the principal
Roles - can be assumed by an entity (i.e. users and resources)
IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO) 	- ideally, you would always use this instead of IAM
											- in practice, the world still heavily realies on the good old IAM

Cognito (User Management service in AWS)
- has 2 components:
	- user pools
	- identity pools

SQS - Simple Queue Service - distributed message queuing service

Lambda - FaaS (function as a service)
