                <h3><u>BMW</u></h3>
                <p><b>BMW</b> might be known as a luxury and performance car maker today, but the company got off the ground, 
                    quite literally, but producing aircraft engines all the way back in 1916. Over the course of more than
                     100 years, <b>BMW</b> has survived two world wars and, despite its current position as a global automaker, 
                     it even came face-to-face with bankruptcy back in the 1960s when things were so bad that 
                     Dr. Hans Feith – the chairman of the company’s Supervisory board – suggested merging with Daimler-Benz.
                      That, however, is a story for another time. Since then, the company turned around and has since
                       introduced its M division back in the late 1970s – the performance arm we’ve all grown to love – 
                       and is now focused on delivering SUVs and developing electric and hybrid cars.
                    BMW is doing so well these days that it produced more than 2.5 million vehicles globally in 2018 and 
                    has now introduced a new halo model – the all-new 8 Series.

                <h3><u>AUDI</u></h3>
                <p><b>Audi</b> AG  is a German
                     automotive manufacturer of luxury vehicles headquartered in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany.
                      As a subsidiary of its parent company, the Volkswagen Group, A<b>Audi</b> produces vehicles in nine production facilities worldwide.
                    The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial
                     enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers
                    (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi 
                    essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[10] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present-day form of the company.
