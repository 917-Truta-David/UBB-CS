INDEXES in SQL Server (Part 2)

Recomandations:
 - Every table should have a cl index
 - The cl index as small as possible, selective, incereasing
 - non-cl indexes on foreign keys and on columns frequently used in WHERE
 - Covering indexes on the most frequently used queries
 - no: index/col
 - multi-col index: put first the most selective column

Indexed Views:

- Views do not hold the data and are not stored phisically on the disk.
- We can create indexes just on materialized views.
- Indexed Views have a bunch of options for example(google them):
	- ANSI_NULLS ON 
	- ANSI_PADDING ON
	- ANSI_WARNINGS ON
	- ARITHABORT ON
	- CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL ON
	- QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
	- NUMERIC_ROUNDABORT ON
- They also have some restrictions:
1) The Indexed View definition can’t reference other views, or tables in other databases.

2) The Indexed View definition can’t have COUNT, MIN, MAX, TOP, outer joins, and some  other keywords. 

3) You can’t modify the underlying tables and columns. The view is created with the WITH SCHEMABINDING option.
 SHEMABINDING  means that as long as that schemabound object exists as a schemabound object  you are limited in 
changes that can be made to the tables that it refers to.

4) Predicting the sql query optimizer is not an exact science. SQL Server Enterprise Edition automatically 
considers the unique clustered index as an option for a query – but if it finds a  more suitable index, 
that will be used. You could force the sql optimizer to use the index through the WITH NOEXPAND hint – but 
using Hints should come with a health warning.

5) Using OLTP with indexed views may create performance problems. 
In a database system with high levels of  insert, updates and deletes, 
this can become a bottleneck. Every data change that occurs in the base table is reflected into the Indexed View.  
If you want to see for  yourself, check the Execution Plan.

IMPORTANT : WARNINGS HAVE SEVERETY LEVEL IN RANGE [1,18], THE ONES ABOVE 10 SHOULD HAVE A TRY-CATCH BLOCK.
            SQL SERVER STORES DATA IN PAGES !!!

Fragmentation: 

1) Internal:
	a) Records are not stored in a contiguous area of memory.
	b) The fullnes of a page depends on time.
	c) ...

2) External:...

3) Logical:...

Reduce fragmentation:
	-Heap : Create a cl index on it and then drop it
		Creating the cl index => the records will get redistributed
	-Indexed table: If Avg fragmentation > 5% anda <= 30%: Rerder the leaf pages of the index: ALTER INDEX name REORGANIZE
					     >30% : Rebuild the index / Drop and recreating the index.
	-Drop and recreate the index => all the data is going to be redistributed int o full data pages.
	-CREATE INDEX name WITH (FILLFACTOR = 70)....


T-SQL Control of Flow Language:

- In computer science, control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an
 imperative program are executed or evaluated.
