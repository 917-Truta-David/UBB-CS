INDEXES in SQL Server (Part 1)

- indexes are strucutured stored on the disk and are associated with a view or table. They are used to optimize
 querries, delete statements, join, etc...
- poor indexing slows down an app, fast indexing speeds it up

  - General syntax: 

	CREATE [UNIQUE] [CLUSTERED] [NONCLUSTERED] 

	INDEX Index_name 

	ON <object_name_table_or_view> (column [ASC| DESC], …) 

	[INCLUDE (col_name , …)] 

	[WHERE <filter_condition>] 

	[WITH (index_option, …)]
